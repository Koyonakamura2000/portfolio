          <p>Designing to support reflection is a relatively new field in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), with minimal literature on what exactly reflection is and how best to design for it.

        <article class="method-single-column">
          <p>We first conducted four semi-structured interviews with people who have reflected at night to explore <b>how they engage in night-time reflection</b> and their <b>emotional experience during reflection</b>. <i>*Names are in pseudonyms</i></p>

              <p>Kyle typically reflects at night once out of every three nights, usually triggered by anxiety or recent academic shortcomings.</p>

              <p>Paul engages himself with his phone or TV until he is exhausted, which helps him fall asleep immediately. He tries to avoid reflecting because thinking about things he has to do fills him with anxiety.</p>

          <p>We also conducted a survey over social media about experiences with reflection in the wider population. We received 44 responses from varying ages, but mostly from people between 18 and 22 years old.</p>
          <p>We asked questions such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Please rate your emotional experience when engaging in reflection.</li>
            <li>How would you compare the way you reflect during the day vs at night?</li>
            <li>Can you think of anything that could improve your night-time reflection experience?</li>

          <p><b>Survey insights:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Around 4 out of 5 respondents (79.5%) engage in night-time reflection at least once a week.</li>
            <li>Night-time reflection tends to be more negative compared to daytime reflection.</li>
            <li>The lack of stimuli (e.g., being in darkness, quietness) triggers reflection.</li>
            <li>Some participants purposely avoid reflection by engaging with their phone until they fall asleep.</li>

        <article class="method-single-column">
          <p>After open coding the interview transcripts, I organized codes into categories through affinity analysis. For the surveys, I performed quantitative analysis on the multiple choice and ranking questions and categorized salient open-ended responses with the interview codes. The interview and survey responses generally coincided, suggesting that the interview responses were fairly representative of the general opinion.</p>

              <h5>Varying attitudes toward technology use in bed</h5>
              <p>Many participants (28/43) felt that the use of technology before bed reduces their quality of sleep, yet some relied on their mobile phones to record thoughts from reflection. Most participants found that looking at bright screens distracted from their efforts to go to sleep. Interestingly, some participants turned to digital technology to intentionally avoid reflection as “the less [they] think when trying to sleep, the better.”</p>

              <h5>Difficulty in acting upon reflection takeaways</h5>
              <p>Some participants felt frustrated when they failed to act upon their reflection takeaways. When asked a question about negative experiences during reflection, one participant replied, “when I don’t act upon my reflections. . . I start to feel really disappointed in myself.”</p>

              <h5>Long reflection hinders efforts to sleep</h5>
              <p>Spending a long time reflecting reduced participants’ quality of sleep. When they fell asleep quickly, participants mentioned feeling happier and more relaxed in the following day. The possibility of spending an excessive time reflecting influenced participants to prefer avoiding reflection.</p>

              <h5>Triggers of night-time reflection</h5>
              <p>Night-time reflective behavior was triggered by a number of factors. Physical and mental fatigue allowed participants to fall asleep quickly. The environment when preparing to sleep, with lights turned off, silence, and isolation, also triggered reflective behavior as people “[didn’t] have anything else to do,” as one interviewee stated.</p>

        <h3>What I learned:</h3>
        <article class="method-single-column">
          <ul>
            <li>Purposely using phones until they exhaust themselves to sleep was surprising.</li>
            <li>Online surveys seem to be highly effective and insightful, especially during the pandemic.</li>
            <li>Being the sole researcher responsible for data analysis was surprisingly easier (due to having only one interpreter of the data) at the cost of potential bias.</li>

        <h3>If I did this again, I would...</h3>
        <article class="method-single-column">
          <ul>
            <li>Research a more specific question: How can we design something that allows the user to record thoughts without it being intrusive to sleep (e.g., not taking notes on devices with bright screens)</li>
            <li>Interview people from different stages in life to see how attitudes toward sleep changes with age</li>
            <li>Perform affinity analysis as a group to reduce unintentional bias in my interpretation of responses.</li>
