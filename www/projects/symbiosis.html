          <p>ForestHealthWatch monitors Western Red Cedar dieback as an indicator for the effects of climate change in the Pacific Northwest. Currently, however, they only have about 100 volunteers collecting this data.

            <li>Varying attitudes toward the use of technology when outdoors, but all were eager to “disconnect from the network” (e.g., social media)</li>
