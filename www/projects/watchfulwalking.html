          <p>University Way Northeast, or, more commonly, "the Ave" is a long stretch of restaurants and shops that many University of Washington students who live in apartments commute through to attend classes. Unfortunately, the area also has a high crime rate and many students feel unsafe when walking alone. In this project, we followed the full user-centered design process to research how we could design something that helps people feel safer when commuting the Ave.</p>

          <p>We analyzed the interviews and developed two personas that represent the two prominent user groups - Max, who is concerned about saving time commuting, and Meg, who is concerned about safety.

          <p>We then developed a list of design requirements that need be met by our design in order to empower Meg and help her feel safer walking back to her apartment alone at night.
