# Portfolio website
HTML, CSS, JavaScript files I used to make my portfolio website (koyonakamura.com). 

## Tools
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Details
Static website to showcase my work, mainly related to UX. Fully developed from scratch.

## Next Steps
1. Some pages load slowly due to large image sizes.
2. Add separate view for development-related projects (e.g., Clash Royale Deck Suggestions)
